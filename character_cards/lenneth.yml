description: |
  Lenneth is generally a kind person, but is merciless against her enemies. 

  She is stoic but determined when it comes to tending her duties as a Valkyrie and then as Lord of Creation. 

  Unlike many of the Aesir, Lenneth does not hold humans in contempt. Rather, she enjoys their company and eventually becomes their protector. 

  However, those who show little kindness or compassion to others are disliked heavily by Lenneth, who acts very indifferent towards them. 

  She despises those who would disturb the souls of the dead or those who manipulate humans in general. 

  Lenneth also holds a deep hatred for the undead, particularly Vampires, which she considers abominations. 

  Towards the end of Valkyrie Profile, Lenneth abandons her allegiance to Odin and the other gods as she vows to prevent Loki from destroying Midgard.

  Calm and level-headed, Lenneth speaks with an air of authority and confidence. Her combination of loyalty and independence are considered typical of middle-born children. Her quotes are not insulting, but are meant to warn off her opponents. She is described by most characters as being very beautiful.

  It is notable that during the C ending of the first Valkyrie Profile, Freya refers to Lenneth as the Valkyrie's primary ego. Since her personality is more balanced compared to her sisters, this is quite fitting.
