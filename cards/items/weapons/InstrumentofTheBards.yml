          "An instrument of the bards is an exquisite example of its kind, superior to an ordinary instrument in every way. Seven types of these instruments exist, each named after a legendary bard college. A creature that attempts to play the instrument without being attuned to it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take {@damage 2d4} psychic damage.",
          "You can use an action to play the instrument and cast one of its spells. Once the instrument has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC.",
          "You can play the instrument while casting a spell that causes any of its targets to be {@condition charmed} on a failed saving throw, thereby imposing disadvantage on the save. This effect applies only if the spell has a somatic or a material component.",
