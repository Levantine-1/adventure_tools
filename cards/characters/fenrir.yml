description: |
  Fenrir is a super-sized wolf. At birth, he was already considered a threat to the gods, and as he grew, it became clear that he would turn into a jotunn, or giant, among wolves. As an adolescent, Fenrir was so large that the drool and foam which spill from his mouth formed a river.
